    3 ## Project Context
    4
    5 This is a bilingual (Spanish/English) portfolio and services website. The primary goal is to showcase projects and describe services offered by NeuralCodeLab.
    6
    7 ### Tech Stack
    8
    9 - **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with the App Router (`src/app`).
   10 - **Language**: TypeScript.
   11 - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS. All styling must be done using utility classes. Do not write custom CSS.
   12 - **Internationalization (i18n)**: The site uses a custom `useTranslation` hook located at `src/lib/useTranslation.tsx` which reads from `public/translations.json`. All user-faci
      text **must** be added to this JSON file and rendered using the hook. Do not hardcode text in components.
   13
   14 ### Key Conventions
   15
   16 - **Components**: All components are functional components. Reusable components are located in `src/components`.
   17 - **Pages**: Pages are created using the Next.js App Router folder structure inside `src/app`.
   18 - **Data**: Static content and data are managed in `src/content` and `src/data`.
   19 - **Code Style**: Follow the existing code style and formatting. Pay close attention to the patterns used in existing files.

   25 - **Analyze First**: Before making any changes, analyze the relevant files and understand the existing patterns.
   26 - **Adhere to Conventions**: Strictly follow the tech stack and conventions outlined above.
   27 - **i18n is Mandatory**: When adding or modifying any text, you must use the `useTranslation` hook.
   28 - **Confirm Before Action**: Always explain the changes you are about to make and ask for my confirmation before modifying any files.
